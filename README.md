# IOC_Extractor
This Python script is used to generate Splunk/TAP/etc queries from Excel IOC definition files that match a certain format. I created this as a project to assist a colleague and felt maybe others would find it handy.

This script was written using Python 2.7, and utilizes a number of modules. One you may need to download and acquire yourself is the xlrd module.

This script utilizes a configuration file included via installation using the installer. The source of this script is provided, as well as the NSI installer script used to create the installer, for future improvements and revisions.
